This repo contains lists of recent versions of AWS Lambda layers that contain SignalFx lambda wrappers for Java, Node.js, C#, Python and Ruby.

As an alternative, you can deploy a SignalFx lambda wrapper layer to your AWS account from published SAM template. To do so, when deploying your Lambda function, please search for SignalFx template in Serverless Application Repository.

For maintainers: commits to this repo are made automatically when a build and integration testing in signalfx-lambda-layers repo pass.
